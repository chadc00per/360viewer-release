# What?
This is just two lines of code to make your webside background a 360 image that can be moved around.

#### Add this to the head of your HTML
```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chadc00per/360viewer-release/main/360background.min.js"></script>
```

#### Specify Your Equirectangular Image with ID#image4360viewer in your HTML
```html
<img id="image4360viewer" src="yourimage.jpg" alt="myimage">
```

##### Notes:
The 360 player sits on a z-index of 3, so make sure any other elements are above it.
